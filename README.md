# weather app

I've used slim php 3 micro framework for this project

I was not able to design the UI/UX of the app properly, there's not much to explain but basically it's a 1 page app and only requires 1 action from the user (select a city) and it will populate all the information of that city in the same page (city information, weather forecast and recommened venues)

App screenshots are in `/screenshots` folder

Answers for the SQL questions are in the file `sql1.txt` and `sql2.txt`
